Summary of Conditions with Explanations:-

1. Visiting the registration page (GET request method will be invoked automatically once user vist users/registation page ):

 A. The user opens the registration URL (/register/).

 B. The request method is GET(automatically invoked).

 c. The else block runs first: an empty UserCreationForm is created.

üîÑ Result: A blank registration form is displayed on the web page for the user to fill in.


2.  Submitting valid registration info (POST request method invoked):

 A. The user fills in the form and clicks submit.

 B. The request method is POST ; means the (if request.method == "POST")-> True.

 c. UserCreationForm(request.POST) is used to bind submitted data.

 D. form.is_valid() returns True because: Username is available as username is unique not duplicate.

 E. Passwords match and meet Django's security criteria.

 F. The form data is saved to the database using form.save().

 G. User is redirected to "posts:list" page. [Finally]

‚úÖ Result: User is successfully registered and redirected to the posts list page.


3. Submitting invalid registration info (POST request method invoked):

 A. The user submits the form, but: Username already exists, or Passwords don‚Äôt match, or Password is too weak, etc.

 B. The request method is POST; means the (if request.method == "POST")-> True.

 C. form.is_valid() returns False.

 D. The form is not saved, and no redirect happens ; no another empty from gvien through else-block. 

 E. The same form is returned to the user with error messages through default return render request of viewing form.

‚ùå Result: User stays on the registration page and sees validation errors.
